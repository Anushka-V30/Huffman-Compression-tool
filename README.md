# Huffman Coding File Compressor

A **C++ implementation** of the **Huffman coding algorithm** for **data compression**.  
It includes two utilities:
- **Compressor** â†’ Encodes a file into a compact binary format.  
- **Decompressor** â†’ Restores the original file from its compressed version.

##  Features

- **Lossless Compression** â€“ Output is identical to the original file.  
- **Efficient Algorithm** â€“ Priority queue ensures optimal Huffman Tree generation.  
- **Tree Serialization** â€“ Saves Huffman Tree for accurate decompression.  
- **Self-Contained** â€“ Pure C++ with no external dependencies.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

Huffman coding assigns **variable-length binary codes** to characters based on frequency:  
- Frequent characters â†’ Shorter codes  
- Rare characters â†’ Longer codes  

This minimizes the overall file size.

### ðŸ”¹ Compression Process (`compressor.cpp`)

1. **Frequency Analysis** â€“ Count frequency of each character.  
2. **Build Huffman Tree** â€“  
   - Use a min-heap to merge lowest-frequency nodes.  
   - Repeat until one root node remains.  
3. **Generate Codes** â€“ Traverse the tree to assign binary codes.  
4. **Serialize Tree** â€“ Save tree structure in `.tree` file.  
5. **Encode File** â€“ Replace characters with Huffman codes.  
6. **Write Binary Data** â€“  
   - Pad bitstring to multiple of 8.  
   - Store number of padding bits in the first byte of `.huff` file.  
   - Save compressed binary output.

### ðŸ”¹ Decompression Process (`decompressor.cpp`)

1. **Rebuild Tree** â€“ Load Huffman Tree from `.tree` file.  
2. **Read Compressed Data** â€“  
   - Get padding count from first byte.  
   - Convert remaining bytes back into bitstream.  
3. **Decode Bitstream** â€“  
   - Traverse tree bit by bit.  
   - Write decoded characters into output file.  
   - Reset to root after reaching each leaf node.
